Bumblebee is an AI-powered Python package that provides **realistic, human-like control** of the mouse and keyboard. Unlike traditional automation tools, Bumblebee leverages deep learning to predict **natural movement patterns**, resulting in automated interactions that feel organic and smooth.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Powered Cursor Movement:**  
  Employs an RNN augmented with an LSTM layer to create smooth, human-like mouse trajectories. These paths are further refined by introducing natural noise and variable speeds, resulting in movements that mimic real human behavior seamlessly.
- **Smart Keystroke Simulation:**  
  Emulates typing with natural delays, punctuation handling, and variability in keystroke timing.
- **Extensive Training Data:**  
  Trained on a dataset of over 25,000 real cursor movements for enhanced realism.
- **Reinforcement Learning (Coming Soon):**  
  Future updates will integrate RL to further refine cursor behavior.
- **PyAutoGUI Integration:**  
  Utilizes [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/) and [pynput](https://pynput.readthedocs.io/) for simulating robust mouse and keyboard interactions.
- **Built with PyTorch:**  
  All AI models are developed using PyTorch.

## üöÄ How It Works

### üñ±Ô∏è Cursor Movement

Bumblebee predicts the cursor path using an RNN-LSTM model trained on extensive real-world cursor data. This approach avoids the robotic jumps seen in conventional automation tools, ensuring smooth and natural motion.

Currently, Bumblebee's mouse moves on almost the same path if the same initial and destination positions are provided, with some noise.

> **Coming Soon:**  An enhanced model incorporating Reinforcement Learning (RL) that will generate different form of paths even if same initial and destination is provided.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Control

The keyboard simulation is driven by:
- **Mathematical Models:**  
  Considering distances between keys and natural typing rhythms.
- **Timing Variations:**  
  Simulated delays for each keystroke to mimic human typing quirks.
- **Punctuation & Special Characters Handling:**  
  Adjusted behaviors to reflect realistic typing patterns.

### üèóÔ∏è Under the Hood

- **Simulation:**  
  Uses [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/) for executing mouse events and [pynput] (https://pynput.readthedocs.io/) for executing keyboard events.
- **Deep Learning:**  
  Powered by PyTorch models trained on self-collected datasets of human interactions for predicting intermediate points between starting position and destination.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

1. Install Bumblebee

```bash
pip install the-bumblebee
```
2. Import the core modules and use them as following:

#### Mouse Control Examples

```python
from bumblebee import Mouse

# Initialize controllers
mouse = Mouse()


# Set mouse speed (pixels per second)
mouse.set_speed(1000)

# Move mouse to specific coordinates
mouse.move(100, 200)

# Drag mouse from the current position to a new location
mouse.drag_to(233, 244)

# Simulate a mouse click (button options: "left", "middle", "right", "primary", "secondary")
mouse.click(button="left")

# Move to a position then click
mouse.move_to_and_click(destX=150, destY=250, button="left")
```

#### Keyboard Control Example

Initialize the Keyboard controller and adjust its typing behavior:

```python
from bumblebee import Keyboard

# Initialize the Keyboard controller with default parameters:
#   - typing_speed: 100 (default percentage of ideal speed)
#   - consistency: 95 (default consistency percentage, affecting delay variability)
#   - typo_rate: 5 (default typo frequency percentage)
keyboard = Keyboard()

# Adjust typing speed.
# The typing speed is provided as a percentage relative to the original Bumblebee typing speed.
# Acceptable types: int or float.
keyboard.set_speed(new_speed=400)  # Increase the typing speed to 400%

# Adjust typo rate.
# The new typo rate must be a value between 0 and 100 (int or float).
keyboard.set_typo_rate(3)  # Set typo rate to 3%

# Adjust consistency.
# A higher consistency (0-100) increases typing speed with less delay variability.
keyboard.set_consistency(99)  # Set consistency to 99%

# Type a sample text.
text = "Bumblebee is great."
keyboard.type(text)  # 'text' must be a string.
```
